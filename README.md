Reuben Thomas’s personal BibTeX databases and style files

This repository is intended purely for use by other of my projects, and the
contents is probably not much use to others, but you’re welcome to use it if
it is.

Those files which are not otherwise marked are by me, and their contents is
placed in the public domain, insofar as I can do that.

A couple of files have other copyrights or licenses; those are mentioned in
the relevant files.
