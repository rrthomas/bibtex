  abstract = 	"Instruction scheduling is essential for the efficient
		 operation of today's and tomorrow's processors. It
		 can be stated easily and declaratively as a logic
		 program. Consistency techniques embedded in logic
		 programming makes the efficient solution of this
		 problem possible. This paper describes an instruction
		 scheduling program for the Motorola 88100 RISC
		 processor, which minimizes the number of pipeline
		 stalls. The scheduler is written in the constraint
		 logic programming language ARISTO and uses a
		 declarative model of the processor to generate an
		 optimal schedule.  The model uses lists of domain
		 variables to represent the pipeline stages and
		 describes the dependencies between instructions by
		 constraints in order to ensure correct scheduling.
		 Although optimal instruction scheduling is
		 NP-complete, the scheduler can be applied to real
		 programs because of the speed gained through
		 consistency techniques."

		  whole interpreter for every possible state of the
		  cache; the execution of a primitive usually changes
		  the state of the cache and the next primitive is
		  executed in the version corresponding to the new
		  state. In the static method a state machine that

		  compiler. Common primitives exist in versions for
		  several states, but it is not necessary to have a

		  speculatively. We propose delayed exceptions, a
		  combination of hardware and compiler extensions that
		  can provide high performance and correct exception 
		  handling in compiler-based speculative execution.
		  Delayed exceptions exploit the fact that exceptions
		  are rare. The compiler assumes the typical case (no
		  exceptions), schedules the code accordingly, and
		  inserts run-time checks and fix-up code that ensure
		  correct execution when exceptions do happen."

                  execution time on arguments of virtual machine
                  instructions. This paper explores two methods to
                  reduce this overhead for virtual stack machines by
                  caching top-of-stack values in (real machine)
                  registers. The {\em dynamic method} is based on
                  having, for every possible state of the cache, one
                  specialized version of the whole interpreter; the
                  execution of an instruction usually changes the
                  state of the cache and the next instruction is
                  executed in the version corresponding to the new
                  state. In the {\em static method} a state machine
                  that keeps track of the cache state is added to the
                  compiler. Common instructions exist in specialized
                  versions for several states, but it is not necessary
                  to have a version of every instruction for every
                  cache state. Stack manipulation instructions are
                  optimized away."

                  code which the current generation of optimizing C
                  compilers compiles to efficient machine code.  I.e.,
                  the resulting code keeps stack items in registers
                  and rarely updates the stack pointer. This paper
                  presents a simple translation method that produces
                  efficient C code, describes an implementation of the
                  method and presents results achieved with this
                  implementation: The translated code is 4.5--7.5
                  times faster than Gforth (the fastest measured
                  interpretive system), 1.3--3 times faster than
